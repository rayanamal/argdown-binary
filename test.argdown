[Thesis]: Censorship by the state
  + <P1>: Freedom of speech is never an absolute right but an aspiration.
  It ceases to be a right when it causes harm to others -- we all
  recognise the value of, for example, legislating against
  incitement to racial hatred. Therefore it is not the case that
  censorship is wrong in principle. #pro
  + <P2>: Certain types of literature or visual image have been
  conclusively linked to crime. Excessive sex and violence in film
  and television has been shown (especially in studies in the US)
  to contribute to a tendency towards similar behaviour in spectators.
  There is no excuse for this and such images must be sacrificed,
  no matter what their artistic merit. #pro
  - <C1>: Censorship is wrong in principle. However violently we may
  disagree with a person's point of view or mode of expression, they
  must be free to express themselves in a free and civilized society.
  Censorship such as legislation against incitement to racial hatred
  drives racists and others underground and thus entrenches and
  ghettoises that section of the community rather than drawing
  its members into open and rational debate. #con
  - <C2>: In fact, the link between sex and violence on screen and
  in real life is far from conclusive. To look at it from another
  angle, those individuals who _already have tendencies_ to
  violence are likely to watch violent `video nasties', just as
  those with a predilection for rape are likely to use pornography.
  The two are therefore connected but the individual's personality
  is formed first. #con
